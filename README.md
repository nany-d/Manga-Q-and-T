Brief

Create an app which helps you decide what manga to read and also tracks read manga, with the option to rate them. Utilises CRUD functionality.

Technologies to use:

Jira – Planning

Git – Version Control

MySQL – Database

Java + Spring – Backend

HTML/ CSS/ JavaScript – FrontEnd

Testing – MockMvc (Integration Testing) + Mockito (Unit Testing) ran in Junit

Jira Board

Setting out the project: I used Jira Software to plan my project, modelled as an Agile Scrum Board.

My user stories dividing into two epics for frontend and backend work:

Midway through working on my first of two day-long sprints:

Git

Git Network Graph of completed project:

Database:

MySQL database with headers and sample information:

A local H2 Console is used for testing.

Backend

The backend is run on Java with a Spring boot framework. It responds to the HTTP requests send by the front-end and updates the MySQL database.

Frontend

The front-end uses HTML, CSS and JS, as well as the Bootstrap framework. Axios is used to send requests to the back-end.

Reflection

• POSITIVES

• + Well written code in front and back end

• +Scalable product which feels like it could be relevant to people

• +Scalable product with a target audience

• TARGETS

• - Wasn’t able to implement enums for ReadStatus and Rating

• - Front-end could be further refined to be more user friendly

• - Second database for manga entries would mean less hard-coding in the front-end

Author

I would like to acknowledge QA trainers Jordan Harrison and Jordan Benbelaid for their teaching as well as my BAE cohort, in particular Team 3.
